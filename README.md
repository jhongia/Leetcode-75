This repository tracks my journey solving the **LeetCode 75 Study Plan** — a curated set of 75 essential algorithm and data structure problems commonly used in technical interview preparation. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Rather than just submitting code, I focus on writing **clean, efficient, and interview‑ready solutions** with patterns I can reuse across similar problem types.
