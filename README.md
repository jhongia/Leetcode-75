This repository documents my journey solving the **LeetCode 75 Study Plan** — a curated set of 75 essential data structure and algorithm problems commonly asked in technical interviews.  

Rather than just submitting solutions, I focus on writing **clean, efficient, and interview-ready code**, while understanding the patterns and logic behind each problem.
