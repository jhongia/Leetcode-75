Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
 

Constraints:

0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

        dp = [[0 for i in range(len(word1)+1)] for j in range(len(word2)+1)]
        for i in range(len(word1)+1):
            dp[0][i] = i
        for j in range(len(word2)+1):
            dp[j][0] = j
        for j in range(1, len(word2)+1):
            for i in range(1, len(word1)+1):
                if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:
                    dp[j][i] = dp[j-1][i-1]
                else:
                    dp[j][i] = min(dp[j][i-1], dp[j-1][i], dp[j-1][i-1]) + 1
        return dp[j][i]
